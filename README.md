# CatDog-CNN-Image-Recognition

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing whether an image contains a dog or a cat. The model is trained on a dataset comprising 4,000 images of cats and 4,000 images of dogs in the training set. Additionally, it includes a test set with 1,000 images of cats and 1,000 images of dogs to evaluate the model's performance on previously unseen data.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset used in this project is organized into three folders:

1. **Data**: Contains all the images of cats and dogs used in the project.
2. **Training Set**: Consists of 8,000 images (4,000 cats and 4,000 dogs) used to train the CNN model.
3. **Test Set**: Includes 2,000 images (1,000 cats and 1,000 dogs) to evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen data.
4. **Production Test**: Reserved for testing the model in a production environment.

## Model Performance

The CNN model has achieved an accuracy of 0.9046 on the test set, which means it correctly identifies cats and dogs in images 90.46% of the time. To use the model, simply provide an image, and it will predict whether it contains a cat or a dog.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize whether an image contains a dog or a cat. The trained model is evaluated using the provided test set to assess its accuracy and performance.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can find the requirements in the project's `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for training and evaluating the CNN model.
4. Use the test set to assess the model's performance on previously unseen images.
5. Finally, test the model in a production environment using the "Production Test" folder.
